## UnDotNet ðŸ‘‹

Aim to be a collection of high quality project to get you started quickly on DotNet projects.

These are things we have to create or manually configure with almost every project we build, and we got tired of it.

There are a crazy number of services that offer this for various prices, but we wanted to start an open source collection of such projects.

### Ideas

- Auth
- Emailing

#### Credits

The UnDotNet (Universal/Unified) name came from [UnJS](unjs.io)
